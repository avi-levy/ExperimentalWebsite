    			<p>\
    			Completing the advanced physics curriculum as a sophomore undergrad, I began work on an honors thesis with Dr. Yuri Gartstein: <em>F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer from a quantum dot into a semiconductor</em>. The project has applications to the design of hybrid nanostructures based on nonradiative energy transfer. We successfully demonstrated the theoretical basis for an anomalous experimental effect, whereby <em>decreasing</em> the thickness of a semiconductor can sometimes <em>increase</em> the amount of energy transfer. We modelled the semiconductor as a lattice of <em>polarizable point dipoles</em>, which allowed us to compute the energy transfer by solving large systems of equations. To perform the computation, I taught myself PV-WAVE, a dialect of FORTRAN that ran on our supercomputing system. After running simulations over a range of parameters, we observed the <em>local field effects</em> we were searching for.\
